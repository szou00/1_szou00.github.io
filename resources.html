						</button>
					</div>
					<p style="color: #000000 !important;">
						Your first and most important step should be to apply for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), also known as “food stamps”). If you are living in the United States, or through any social programs your country has set up if you’re living outside the United States. With EBT, most individuals can qualify for $200 worth of funds that can be used to purchase food each month. However, the amount of assistance available for each family depends on many different factors.

					<p style="color: #000000 !important;">
						Most shelters that offer beds also offer food services, at least in the United States, the UK, Australia, and the majority of developed countries. Some may offer some packaged foods or bags of food, but the vast majority of them offer home-cooked style meals and the food is normally donated to them by charities, food drives, and nearby grocery stores or other companies.

						</button>
					</div>
					<p style="color: #000000 !important;">
						When it comes to packaged meals and groceries, food pantries seem to be the best place to go for this. Most food pantries will hand out a large grocery bag full of ready to eat food, food that involves cooking, or a combination of both. However, they will often limit how many times you can visit them within a certain time period.

						Most churches (the decent ones anyways), will offer some form of charity to the homeless in the form of food at certain times or on certain days. They will either offer warm meals that are served on the premises, or they will offer some form of bagged meals, which is usually a brown paper bag filled with essentials such as a sandwich, a banana, and a juice box. For instance, The St. Vincent De Paul Society was established in the U.S. in 1845 and is operated by the Catholic Church. It has the mission is to provide for all those in need. The organization provides church food pantries in a variety of communities, as well as thrift stores that provide clothing and a wide range of other services.

				New Alternatives primarily assists LGBTQ+ youth who are 16-24 years of age and homeless or at risk. They define homelessness broadly to include youth living on the street, youth in shelters or transitional living programs, and youth without a permanent place to stay. New clients always are accepted on a walk-in basis every Monday, Friday, and Sunday at the hours listed below, and they are located in Metro Baptist Church at 410 West 40th Street, New York, NY 10018. New Alternatives welcomes all youth as they are without judgment and with no barriers to entry. Identification and paperwork are not required for registration, and a referral letter is not necessary. They also will provide verification of attendance upon request.
